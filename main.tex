\section{Executive Summary}
% Purpose: Summarize the objectives, key findings, and recommendations of the analysis.

% Overview: Provide a brief description of the Algo Centre Mall collapse, including the date, location, and immediate consequences.

\section{Introduction}
% Background: Detail the history of the Algo Centre Mall, including its construction in 1979-1980, architectural features like the rooftop parking, and its significance to the Elliot Lake community.

% Incident Summary: Outline the events leading up to the collapse on June 23, 2012, the collapse itself, and the immediate aftermath.

% Scope and Methodology: Explain the CAST methodology and its relevance to analyzing this particular incident.

\section{System Description}
% Structural Overview: Describe the mall's structural components, such as the steel beams, columns, and precast hollow-core concrete slabs.

% Stakeholders and Roles: Identify key stakeholders, including the original builders, subsequent owners, engineers, architects, maintenance personnel, and municipal authorities.

% Operational Context: Discuss the mall's operational history, including known issues like persistent roof leaks and previous maintenance efforts.



\section{Safety Control Structure}
% Control Hierarchy: Map out the safety control structure, detailing how safety constraints were supposed to be enforced from design through operation.

% Communication Channels: Examine the communication pathways among stakeholders and how information about structural issues was shared or neglected.

% Regulatory Oversight: Assess the role of municipal and provincial regulations in ensuring building safety and how these may have failed.

\underline{System Goals}

G1. Provide a safe, functional, and accessible commercial environment for the residents and visitors of Elliot Lake

G2. Ensure the structural integrity of the building throughout its lifecycle

\underline{Losses}

L1. Human losses: loss of life, physical injuries and psychological harm

L2. Material and structural losses: destruction of property and economic losses

L3. Institutional and professional failures: loss of public trust, damage to the image of the engineering profession, and less trust in governmental accountability

L4. Disruption to society: loss of a commercial space, and breakdown of emergency responses

\underline{Hazards}

H1. Corrosion of the structure due to leaking from the rooftop parking deck [L1, L2, L3, L4]

H2. Ineffective inspection and maintenance routine [L1, L2, L3, L4]

H3. Inadequate engineering assessments [L1, L2, L3, L4]

H4. Regulatory and oversight gaps [L1, L2, L3, L4]

H5. Unclear responsibility allocation and poor communication [L1, L2, L3, L4]

H6. Economic and political pressures [L4]

H7, Unpreparedness when an emergency emerges [L1, L3, L4]

\underline{System Safety Requirements and Constraints}

SR1: The building must be designed and maintained to ensure long-term structural integrity under expected environmental and usage conditions. [H1]

SC1: Structural components must not be allowed to degrade to the point of losing load-bearing capacity. [H1]

SR2: Regular, thorough inspections of critical infrastructure (e.g., roof, support beams) must be conducted by qualified professionals. [H2]

SC2: Identified structural deficiencies must be documented transparently and acted upon within a reasonable time frame. [H2]

SR3: Engineering assessments must be objective, evidence-based, and prioritize public safety over client interests. [H3]

SC3: Engineers must communicate risk levels clearly and explicitly, including in cases where conditions are unsafe or immediate action is needed. [H3]

SR4: Municipal and provincial authorities must have mechanisms to enforce that the building safety standards are followed. [H4]

SC4: Regulatory bodies must step in when reports indicate serious structural risks, including through orders, fines, or building closure. [H4]

SR5: Property owners must allocate resources for ongoing maintenance and be held accountable for not doing repairs that pose safety risks. [H5]

SC5: Cost-saving measures must not go above the minimum safety standards required for public occupancy. [H5]

SR6: Emergency response plans must account for building collapse scenarios and provide for safe, timely rescue efforts. [H6]

SC6: Emergency response should not be suspended without an effective alternative strategy when lives may be at risk. [H6]

SR7: The public and tenants must be informed about any significant structural safety risks affecting the buildings they use. [H7]

SC7: Safety-related information must not be kept away from the public due to commercial, political, or reputational concerns. [H7]


\section{Event Analysis}
% Timeline of Events: Construct a detailed timeline from the mall's construction to the collapse, highlighting key events such as inspections, reports of leaks, and maintenance actions.

% Failure Points: Identify specific points where safety constraints were breached, such as ignored engineering reports or inadequate repairs.

% Systemic Factors: Analyze how systemic issues, like organizational culture or economic pressures, contributed to the failure.

\section{Causal Factors and Contributing Conditions}
% Immediate Causes: Detail the direct technical reasons for the collapse, such as corrosion of structural components.

% Underlying Systemic Causes: Explore deeper systemic issues, including decision-making processes, accountability structures, and resource allocations that allowed the immediate causes to develop.

% Human and Organizational Factors: Assess how human behavior, organizational culture, and management decisions contributed to the incident.

\section{Recommendations}
% Design and Maintenance: Suggest improvements in building design practices and maintenance protocols to prevent similar failures.

% Regulatory Reforms: Propose changes to regulatory frameworks to enhance oversight and enforcement of safety standards.

% Organizational Changes: Recommend organizational reforms to improve communication, accountability, and safety culture among stakeholders.

\section{Conclusion}
% Summary of Findings: Recap the key insights gained from the CAST analysis.

% Implications for Future Practice: Discuss how these findings can inform future practices in building design, maintenance, and regulation.
