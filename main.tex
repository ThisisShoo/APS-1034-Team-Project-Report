\section*{Executive Summary}
% Purpose: Summarize the objectives, key findings, and recommendations of the analysis.

% Overview: Provide a brief description of the Algo Centre Mall collapse, including the date, location, and immediate consequences.

\section{Introduction} 
% - History of the mall, chain of events, as well as the methodology for analysis 
% Background: Detail the history of the Algo Centre Mall, including its construction in 1979-1980, architectural features like the rooftop parking, and its significance to the Elliot Lake community.
% Incident Summary: Outline the events leading up to the collapse on June 23, 2012, the collapse itself, and the immediate aftermath.
% Scope and Methodology: Explain the CAST methodology and its relevance to analyzing this particular incident.

The Algo Centre Mall, located in Elliot Lake, Ontario, was constructed between 1979 and 1980 by Algocen Realty Holdings Ltd. Housing a public library, a government service center, a hotel and retirement residence, and various retail stores, the mall served not only as a commercial hub but also as a community gathering space. The three-story structure was composed of concrete and steel-reinforced concrete slabs supported by a steel frame, sitting on a sloped terrain facing northeast. A parking deck was built on the roof, which was accessible via ramps along the hillside. The parking deck was supported by a steel frame held together by bolted and welded connections, with a layer of hollow core concrete slabs on top. In 2012, a section of the roof deck collapsed after a long history of water leaks, structural deterioration, and, most importantly, neglect, resulting in the deaths of two people and over twenty injuries. This report aims to analyze the Algo Centre Mall collapse using the CAST (Causal Analysis based on System Theory) methodology, which focuses on understanding the systemic factors that contributed to the incident. The following section first provides a relatively brief history of the Algo Centre Mall and its deteriorating conditions leading up to the collapse, then gives an overview of the CAST methodology, and finally outlines the structure of this  report.

\subsection{History of the Algo Centre Mall}

Throughout the years that immediately followed its construction, the mall was plagued by significant structural issues, particularly with water leaks from the rooftop parking deck, owing to failed waterproofing measures. Such water leaks, along with cracks that developed in the concrete slabs, were reported as early as 1981, and the building's condition continued to deteriorate over the years. Ten years later, a report prepared by Trow Consulting Engineers Ltd. found that although the rooftop parking deck was generally in good condition, various components of the building had visible signs of deterioration, including the aftermath of failed repairs, sections of broken concrete, and surface rust on exposed steel. In the Report of the Elliot Lake Commission of Inquiry (henceforth referred to as the Elliot Lake Report) \cite{AlgoLakeReport1}, it was noted that the proposed waterproofing for the rooftop parking deck only met the requirements of the Ontario Building Code at that time on a technicality, for the 1975 code never specified what the waterproof membrane should be made of. Although a waterproof sealant was relied upon to act as a waterproofing membrane, it clearly failed to do so, as water leaks continued to be reported throughout the years. 

The aforementioned 1991 Trow report also indicated an abnormal amount of chloride content in the slabs, presumably from the de-icing salts used on the parking deck or brought in by vehicles, which proved to have exacerbated the corrosion of the steel components. Trow recommended the installation of a new waterproof membrane and a layer of asphalt to replace the existing concrete topping, but this recommendation was rejected by Algocen due to the high cost of repairs and the disruption of income from the mall's hotel. Testimonies from the Elliot Lake Report indicated that Algocen Realty Holdings was financially capable of performing the renovations, but they never changed the way they dealt with the leakage, and eventually sold the mall to Elliot Lake Retirement Living as-is. During this transaction, Algocen did not provide Retirement Living with any of the engineering reports describing the structural issues and leaks. Algocen constructed the mall as they foresaw Elliot Lake's expansion in the 1980s, but quickly sought to offload its responsibilities to the mall as the mining boom died. As soon as the mall stops being the hub of the community in a rising town, it quickly became a financial liability to be sold off. 

The Elliot Lake Retirement Living (ELRL, or ``Retirement Living'') is a non-profit organization established in 1991 to promote Elliot Lake as a retirement community. Formerly a uranium mining town, Elliot Lake's population reached its peak in the 1980s due to the mining boom, but the closure of the mines in the early 1990s dealt a huge blow to the local economy, and the city's population has been in steady decline ever since \cite{ElliotLakePopulation}. With Retirement Living taking the center stage in the city's transformation into a retirement community, the organization bought many properties in Elliot Lake, including the Algo Centre Mall in 1999 from Algocen Realty Holdings, to convert them into retirement getaways \cite{NYT1996}. Retirement Living incorporated NorDev, a for-profit subsidiary, to manage the properties, including the mall and the hotel. Despite the close ties between Retirement Living and the city council, the organization was not obligated to share with the city any information that may harm the organization, including the reports on the state of the Algo Centre Mall. 

The Elliot Lake Report also indicated that Retirement Living had no plans to fully address the roof deck issue. The mall's property manager, Mr. Richard Quinn, testified in front of the Commission counsel to further confirm that the organization simply continued the same practices as before it acquired the property, except the maintenance team simply became more adept at patching the leaks, but never at preventing those leaks from happening in the first place. Further, he testified that he interpreted the 1999 Halsall report, which was acquired by Retirement Living as it purchased the mall, as an endorsement of the ongoing maintenance practices. The Halsall report suggested two options for the roof deck: either find and seal all the cracks, or install a waterproof membrane. However, Halsall presented the second option with the requirement that all the cracks must be thoroughly found and sealed, though this point was not sufficiently emphasized. Having mistaken Halsall's suggestion as an endorsement for continuous maintenance, the mall continued to utilize its own maintenance team instead of hiring qualified contractors, and its deterioration proceeded along its course through Retirement Living's ownership of the Algo Centre Mall. During this time, Retirement Living was in a good enough financial standing to perform a permanent fix to the roof deck, which was quoted by Halsall to cost \$776,000, but Retirement Living and NorDev instead spent \$1.3 million to attract Zellers, a major Canadian retailer, to the mall, as well as at least \$1.4 million in the golf course. Given the shockingly little amount that was really spent on the parking deck, as indicated in the Elliot Lake Report, it becomes clear that the 2012 collapse could have been avoided had Retirement Living and NorDev not prioritized the mall's business opportunities over the safety of the building.

Eastwood Mall Inc. (henceforth referred to as ``Eastwood''), wholly owned by Mr. Bob Nazarian, would later purchase the mall in 2005 at a discount. It was later revealed in the Elliot Lake Report that Retirement Living was attempting to sell off the mall to Eastwood without disclosing the full extent of the mall's crumbling conditions, which was remarkably reminiscent of the deal between it and Algocen Realty Holdings. In his interview with the Commission, Mr. Nazarian commented as such about his other property purchases in August 2009: ``The Algo Mall was a black hole that no matter how much money you put in, [...] that mall was doomed.''\cite{AlgoLakeReport1}. Indeed, neither maintaining nor renovating the mall was going to be cheap long-term, and they would not have directly contributed to any financial returns, but the mall was still quite a profitable business, as indicated by the financial statements of Retirement Living, also shown in the Elliot Lake Report. This quote more goes to show how little Nazarian was interested in investing in the mall. Instead of hiring outside engineering firms to conduct a thorough inspection of the mall, Nazarian relied on the Royal Bank of Canada's (RBC) engineers to assess it, as part of the loan application process before Nazarian could purchase the mall. As pointed out in the Elliot Lake Report, not conferring with outside consultation is not at all uncommon in Mr. Nazarian's business practices. This ignorance was further exacerbated by Retirement Living's refusal to disclose the structural issues from Eastwood, RBC, and the firm retained by RBC to survey the mall's condition, Construction Control. 

The fact that Eastwood's purchase turned out to be as problem-laden as the Algo Centre Mall may somewhat be attributed to sheer bad luck. One may also consider them amateurish or superficial in their efforts as they failed to thoroughly inspect the mall before spending millions of dollars to purchase it. However, the sheer multitude of neglect and indifference that ensued after the purchase, which led to the eventual loss of two lives, is simply inexcusable. Based on the interview mentioned above, Mr. Nazarian was aware of the mall's conditions no later than August 2009, almost from the beginning of his ownership of the mall. 

% Eastwood may have simply been unlucky as it purchased a mall with structural issues as deeply rooted as the Algo Centre Mall, as well as being superficial in its attempt to assess the property it was trying to purchase. 

% However, its management practices during its ownership of the mall displayed a clear lack of concern for the safety of the building and its tenants, thus sabotaging the mall's final chance of survival. 

% After Eastwood, use a paragraph to describe the contributions of the Ministry of Labor and the City Council, then conclude this subsection
